## Getting Started

To get started with the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A-Charvin/climatedata.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the repository directory**:
   ```bash
   cd climatedata
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**: ( It is recommended to use ArcGIS or Conda)
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```
4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
